Getopt::Guided - ...

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports the C<getopts()> subroutine on request. The subroutine
has two mandatory parameters: An option specification that is a string and a hash.
It processes @ARGV and shrinks it accordingly and stores the processing results in the hash.

C<getopts()> croaks if a processing error was detected; otherwise the subroutine returns nothing.

It supports the POSIX utility syntax guidelines 3 to 10, inclusive, L<Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines|https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604399/basedefs/xbd_chap12.html#tag_12_02>

# - One or more options without option-arguments, followed by at most one option that takes an option-argument, should be accepted when grouped behind one '-' delimiter.
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26542155/getopt-accepting-other-option-as-argument-in-c
# - Each option and option-argument should be a separate argument

# - The first -- argument that is not an option-argument should be accepted as a delimiter indicating the end of options. Any following arguments should be treated as operands, even if they begin with the '-' character.

# - All options should precede operands on the command line.
