=head1 NAME

Getopt::Guided - getopts implementation that follows POSIX utility guidelines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Getopt::Guided qw( getopts );

  local @ARGV = qw( -c -v -a foo -vv );
  my %opts = ( d => 'bar' );
  getopts 'a:bcd:v', %opts;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module reimplements the C<getopts()> function of the L<Getopts::Std>
core module.  The new implementation supports only the two-parameter
form of C<getopts()>.  The first parameter is a string that contains the
option characters.  The second parameter is a hash reference that stores
the processing result. Each hash key refers to a provided option character
and the corresponding hash value refers to the option-argument (or C<1>
if it is a flag). This module exports the C<getopts()> function on request.

The new implementation follows the L<POSIX utility syntax
guidelines|https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02>
4 to 10, inclusive. C<getopts()> warns and returns false if a processing error
occurs; otherwise the function returns true. The processing error types are:

=over 2

=item 1. illegal option

=item 2. option requires an argument

=item 3. option with argument isn't last one in group

=back

The second processing error occurs if either no argument or the C<undef>
value is provided for an option that requires an option-argument.

If any of the processing errors occurs, C<getopts()> restores C<@ARGV>
and C<%opts> (its second parameter) before it warns and returns false.

An option that requires no option-argument is called a flag. If a flag
is provided, its hash value is C<1>, which in perl boolean context means
true. If the same flag is provided multiple times, the implementation could
keep the hash value. But for perl each positive integer is true in boolean
context. Therefore each occurrence of the flag increments its hash value
by one.  For example, this is useful for incrementing a verbosity level
represented by the C<-v> flag.

=head1 CAVEAT

Even if you are currently using the two-parameter form of the C<getopts()>
function of C<Getopts::Std>, the new implementation isn't a drop in
replacement.
